        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "My partner and I recently got rights to rent an allotment garden nearby in the city. It is approximately 100 square metres, and took a *lot* of effort to turn and perma-culture to make it usable. The soil is mostly clay, which doesn't hold too well water.\n",
        "\n",
        "Being a bit of a techy myself, a thought occurred to me: \"We have an Arduino board that we never use. What if we'd make some sort of sensor to let us know when to water?\". Very lazy, I admit, but an intriguing project.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have some programming background, mainly in R and Android Java development, so I thought it might be an easy enough project. A few weeks in now, and we're seeing some progression, so I reckon I could write a few blog posts about it. This is the first post.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Arduino?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Arduino microprocessor is a tiny and cheap integrated programming development board. It has everything you need to get started with some very rudimentary microprocessing development - but the magical part about it is that it scales to almost anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "Really, the only reason we chose the Arduino was that we have one at home. My partner had bought a starter kit some years back, which he fiddled with for a few weeks and left in a box to rot (rust?). So I thought we could use that!\n",
        "\n",
        "Basically, the Arduino (ours is an Uno Rev3) is a small computer with a lot of input and output pins. You interact with the computer by writing code in flavoured C++, which is compiled and transferred over to the Arduino's internal memory. Once the device has power - through USB, a battery, or even solar panels - it runs the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "On its own, it's not very impressive. However, the Arduino admits almost any type of sensors, attachments, and devices to plug in. To interact with the world, you have gyroscopes, accelerometers, sensors for moisture, temperature, barometers, you name it.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What's the purpose, then?\n",
        "\n",
        "We decided to start with one \"simple\" functionality: *Measure the soil moisture at the allotment and transfer it wirelessly to us.* This seems somewhat simple, but - as it turns out - every step has to be manually configured and constructed. Also, I need to learn C++, no biggie.\n",
        "\n",
        "To break the steps down, we figured we need to do something like:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Measure the soil moisture using a sensor.\n",
        "2.  Bring that data into the Arduino.\n",
        "3.  Do things to the data.\n",
        "4.  Store the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "So let's get into what we have accomplished so far - which is mostly step one and two!\n",
        "\n",
        "# Reading the External World\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite what philosophers of science might argue, measuring the external world is actually very simple. For the Arduino, we opted to use the Grove ecosystem of sensors, since it seemed well-documented and easy-to-use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our first purchases were the Grove connector shield and a pile of moisture sensors. The [connector shield](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Base_Shield_V2/) simply \"translates\" the special four-pin connector on most Grove sensors into the pins that the Arduino reads. The word \"shield\" means that it sits neatly on top of the Arduino, so that you don't have to do any wiring. Neat!\n",
        "\n",
        "The [moisture sensors](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Moisture_Sensor/) are small two-pronged forks with a four-pin cable attaching to the back of the sensor. The sensor runs a current through the prongs, measures the voltage and returns it through the chosen pin. Using the connector shield, we can hook the whole thing up to the analog pins (since it is only a simple analog current that is being read), in our current case, analog pin 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "![My current testing setup. The boards in the stack from top down: Grove connector shield, data logging shield, Arduino board. Analog pin 0 is connected through the Grove shield to the moisture sensor, which is sitting in a small potted plant.](/images/aa01_testingsetup.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "This, essentially, takes care of step one! Of course, on its own, this does nothing - the Arduino must be told what to do with the data that comes in.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Reading from the Moisture Sensor\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned, the Arduino is programmed in a language called C++ (with some extra Arduino flavour, I've understood). This language is pretty human-readable, though admittedly much more complex than my current working language, R. In a first, very preliminary testing setup, I managed to omit three or four semi-colons, breaking the code instantly...\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus far, I've written a Sketch (the Arduino name for code scripts that are executed on the board) that takes an average of readings with a specific interval and over a defined number of readings, and prints it to the serial console (more on that later).

The former defines how many readings will be done (fifteen in this example), and the latter is an array storing the data read from each reading. The array is defined as an integer (number) array of size `numReadings`, so that it can fit all the necessary sensor readings. Another important variable is `delayTime`, which defines, in milliseconds, how long to wait between each reading.\n",
