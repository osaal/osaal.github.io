abstract:
  In our paper we analyse risk perceptions of individuals based on data collected as part
  of the longitudinal survey series Finnish Emergency Attitudes. We propose that in
  terms of risk perception, risks should be seen as interconnected, intuitively valued, and
  socially mediated. Using factor analysis, we construct a General Risk Probability
  Perception Scale (GRPPS) and analyse the variance in risk perception in three
  different models. We found support for the hypothesis that risk perception is a unitary
  construct, as opposed to composed of singular risk related perceptions of probability.
  General risk perception seems to be related to experiences of actual risk, whether
  direct, near-miss or professional. For social variables, only being male or elderly
  predicts a higher general perception of risk.
