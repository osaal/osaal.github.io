    "text": "Tired and wrung dry, I walked out of the concrete-and-glass main building of the Emergency Services Academy, Pelastusopisto, today. After a hectic month of our annual conference, two days of sessions on risk management, new technologies in forest firefighting, emergency services communications, and many more topics, my current work contract is coming to an end. Luckily, and very surprisingly, I was offered continuation for another half a year. This blog is about the experience of working here, of working in safety and security research, and of working as a public sector researcher.\n\nPelastusop–what?\n“Pelastusopisto - Emergency Services Academy Finland”1 organises the national emergency services education in Finland, from ‘run-of-the-mill’ firefighters to civil protection specialists, emergency responders, and emergency services leadership personnel. It is financed and governed by the Ministry of the Interior, and functions as a specialist school following its own educational regulation, separate from regular second and third cycle educational institutions. Crucial to my own interests, however, it also coordinates, organises, and supports national research into emergency services - something I will collectively call ‘safety and security research.’\n1 Yes, that’s the full name. I’ll use a shortened name henceforth.2 As a native to the southern Finnish shorelines and archipelagos, I find myself surprisingly at home in this in-land city of 120 000 inhabitants, thanks to its vast lakes and island belts. Though, they speak a funny accent here.Originally, I found myself in the inland lake city of Kuopio2 at the Emergency Services Academy in late 2020, as I graduated amidst the COVID19 pandemic and was looking for odd jobs while searching for PhD research funding. I received a position as a research assistant and was tasked primarily with completing the Finnish Attitudes of Emergency Services 2020 report, a triannual survey study on Finnish attitudes towards the emergency services, risk preparedness and personal preparation behaviour, emergency communications preferences, among other topics. The job was short, and I finished the four-month stint visiting the campus only once, even mailing my computer and keys back to Kuopio.\nHowever, I was quite taken aback to be asked to return some two-and-a-half years later, this time as a researcher, to once again complete the Attitudes report for 2023. The job title was fancier, the salary higher, and the contract longer, and the offer came at a time where I was stuck in a rut with my PhD thesis. The change was welcome, in other words. I took up a part-time position for the tail-end of 2022, finishing up my course in Science and Technology Studies and other odd ends of my thesis at Åbo Akademi University before returning once more to the concrete, rather monolithic and imposing main building3 in southern Kuopio.\n3 Seriously, the architecture is impressive. Apparently constructed in 1992 as a winning design in an architectural competition, the campus is composed on multiple concrete buildings, all in various angles to another, with intersecting buildings. My first thought was “Jesus H. Christ, that is awful!“, but it has definitely grown on me over the past half year.\n\nInterdisciplinarity in Action\nThe research conducted at Pelastusopisto is very varied. I came on-board as a social scientist, working with my colleague senior researcher and docent Alisa Puustinen to conduct a nationally representative attitude and knowledge survey study. However, one of my most striking memories must have been one of our monthly on-location days, where our colleague Marjaleena Aatamila presented her research on carcinogen exposure during cooktop burning of a selection of household materials, conducted in co-operation with Aalto University4. As she was presenting parts-per-million measurements of various aldehydes and the rate of change over time as the testing space was aired out, I thought to myself, “I am far away from my sociological home!”\n4 Information in Finnish, as well as a blog in English by Aalto University, on the project.My first point is, indeed, the utter joy of working in such an interdisciplinary group. Apart from me as a sociologist, our researchers are everything from administrative scientists and communications researchers to biologists, pharmacists, physicists, and statisticians. Despite these, we work across borders, co-operating and helping each others in projects we might never have a chance to otherwise conduct. The traditional boundaries between soft and hard, qualitative and quantitative, exact and approximate were constantly blurred, and all our research was better from this diversity of perspectives.\nAnother signal of this interdisciplinarity was how many of us never actually studied anything remotely related to emergency services! Many of us were educated in completely different fielda, finding our way to security and safety research by happenstance. In fact, there is no real educational pathway to becoming a safety and security scientist in Finland - apart from, perhaps, a doctorate in military sciences at the National University of Defense, which none of us had or even particularly aspired to have.\nYet, there is an odd camaraderie in the air among security researchers. We discussed this over the conference dinner among colleagues, and came to the conclusion that the common goal and clearly shared values is a major factor in this. As a sociologist, it has been hammered into me over years of brainwa- education, that most topics have multiple perspectives and often divergent values attached to them. Yet, in embodied practice, as I stand discussing the need for context-sensitive education on home preparedness with a conference attendee, the point of divergent values is hard to argue.\nEmergency services, and safety research in general, strives to save lives, protect citizens, and create safety. If sociological research can sometimes feel like meaningless word salad5, this particular field is hard to view that way. Sure, the odd militarist who speaks of weaponized national defense as part of security-making might be off-putting to those of a more pacifist stint, but it is easy to re-discover one’s calm among colleagues discussing the criticalities of securitization discourses and the need for soft values and human understanding in authority practice.\n5 I should know, I study social phenomenology.6 We are, I concede, financed directly by a ministry. I speak more of the institutional position that emergency services research currently holds, especially in the aftermath of a major social and health care reform.However, this camaraderie can unfortunately be short-lived. When working in an interdisciplinary field whose institutional status is precarious6 and vague, I noticed the distinct lack of inter-departmental communication and network-building. While the Emergency Services Academy is designated as the national coordinator of emergency services research, there is no real connection between all the institutions, both academic and professional, conducting safety and security research in Finland. Many want change to this, but given that most of us work in the public sector, the hinders of a results-driven and highly economized administration may often prove unsurmountable. We lack a common journal, which just adds to the diffusion of research personnel and resources around the country. I would also like to bring up those conducting safety and security research at miscellaneous departments and units across the country, but whose work we rarely see, as the Government Peoples never stray too far into the Murky Shadows of Non-Government Peoples.\nPerhaps this will change soon, however. The newly-unveiled topic for next years conference is (freely translated) ‘Effecting Change Together,’ combining questions of research impact with togetherness and networking. One of the strategic aims of Pelastusopisto is to construct a national network of emergency services researchers. Perhaps that ambition is too small: there are enough of us to construct a network of safety and security researchers from all fields, covering topics such as youth marginalisation, health care safety, firefighting and emergency response, armed conflict resolution, international law, the list goes on.\nThis brings me to the topic more generally. I still am somewhat unclear on what ‘safety and security research’ even means. At its core, however, it seems to be about the understanding of factors related to safety, from the micro to the macro, and how we can effect change which measurably increases safety - whether it be among the population at large, among firefighters in their professional lives, among civilians caught in armed conflicts, among refugees and immigrants. This opens up for uncountable interesting research streams, even (and especially) in the field of social and human sciences. How do people construct a sense of safety? Which actions can a government take to increase safety, both perceived and real? What dangers lie in focussing on perception over actual safety, and what does it even mean to perceive something as ‘safe’ or ‘dangerous?’\n\n\nA Meager, but Very Happy, Conclusion\nAll of this is more or less an ode to joy. I found this community of stray researchers, many in-between academic homes, looking for an institution to house them. In them, I found camaraderie and true interdisciplinarity, in a way I have only seen described in lengthy papers before. It is this community which is so utterly important for the continued well-being of young researchers: the possibility to walk into an office7 and be inspired by the creativity, the variety, and the tenacity of researchers from all across the scientific spectrum.\n7 Not a given for Finnish doctoral researchers, unfortunately!My time at Pelastusopisto has been incredibly rewarding - and as luck would have it, I am given a chance to continue that time. In a sense, I hope I can inspire other doctoral students to look out for these places: the one’s that inspire, the one’s that support and the one’s that push you forward. Academic work can be grueling and thankless - not to talk about the abysmal salaries - so treat yourself, and find a community that supports you.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{saal2023,\n  author = {Saal, Oliver},\n  title = {Among the {Firefighters}},\n  date = {2023-06-21},\n  url = {https://osaal.github.io/posts/safetyandsecuritystudies.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nSaal, Oliver. 2023. “Among the Firefighters.” June 21,\n2023. https://osaal.github.io/posts/safetyandsecuritystudies.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Thursday 16 March, I attended my first meeting with the Early Career Researchers’ committee of the Finnish Union of University Researchers and Teachers, FUURT. I thought the occasion would be a good way to inaugurate this blog - with a stream-of-thought post. Coherent thoughts not guaranteed.\nThe ECR committee is composed of representatives from most Finnish universities, this year eleven out of fourteen universities are represented. The representatives are all early career researchers, spanning from first-year doctoral researchers to established post docs. I was struck by the variety of disciplines, universities, and career paths in this year’s committee - we even have a representative from outside the university, which speaks to the multiple career pathways of post docs.\nThe majority of the meeting was spent in discussing current events at the universities. Topics spanned work contract disputes, information pathways, grant writers, funding problems, salary system disparities, change negotiations and layoffs, new researchs on doctoral researchers’ inequalities of opportunity, and so on.\nIf I were to summarise the main takeaways from the meeting, it would be this: the problems of doctoral students country-wide stem mostly from insecure funding. Again and again, the topic of funding rose up: whether it was the University of Oulu negotiating automatic 10 per cent part-time work contracts for grant researchers, the Ministry of Education and Culture pushing for a shortened doctoral track and interest organisations protesting due to the lack of funding, or the University of Turku laying off 50 people and pushing the rest harder on securing external financing, it all came back to money.\nThe topic I want to work on in this committee, and more general in science policy, is indeed this problem of financing. Finland follows a very peculiar model of doctoral financing, where a large portion of the funding stems from private foundation grants. While this system allows for a certain flexibility in funding opportunities and specialised research, it also presents major problems.\nFirstly, the disparity between grant and salary income levels is far too wide. The average monthly grant size depends on the discipline - itself a questionable aspect! - but varies between 2 100 euros and 2 400 euros gross (Siekkinen et al. 2021). Meanwhile, the minimum recommended starting salary for doctoral researchers in the general collective agreement is 2 200 euros, rising up to a recommended minimum of 2 800 euros in the final stretch of the dissertation process1. Granted, these are recommendations - and not, for instance, followed at my home university - but the possible disparity is large. It is noteworthy, that in either case, doctoral researchers make considerably less than the average Finnish salary for a person with a Master’s degree (the prerequirement for doctoral studies in Finland), regardless of field.\n1 General Collective Agreement for Universities, 1 Aug 2022-31 Mar 2024, available here. Retrieved 21 March 2023.If this gross income disparity was not enough, there is the problems of work benefits. Grant researchers are not employed by anyone, meaning that they lack access to work benefits such as work-provided healthcare. With the current state of the Finnish public healthcare system, privately organised work healthcare is the only reasonable course of action. Considering that a large number of doctoral researchers suffer from mental health issues (themselves related to funding stresses in part!), this access would be crucial (see e.g., Guthrie et al. 2017). Work healthcare also conducts pre-emptive check-ups to a much greater extent than public healthcare, which allows for early recognition of burnout, depression, anxiety, and other such work-related illnesses that arise in the academy. Of course, this healthcare is available to individuals outside a work healthcare agreement, too - if they pay out of pocket or have an insurance policy that covers such expenses. Hardly a viable option for the well-below-median income of a grant researcher, many of whom have families to sustain.\nThere is also the curious problem of taxation. Private research grants in Finland are exempt from taxation (except for a few obligatory health care and public broadcasting-related fees, totaling a few per cent of the income) up to a certain threshold, adjusted yearly by the government. Currently, this threshold is approximately 25 000 euros gross, meaning that most grants fall just below this threshold. Taxes accrue only on the part crossing the threshold. This is, in theory, a just system, but the problems arise when considering tax rebates. Simply put: if you pay no taxes, you get no rebate. This means no deductions for having a home office, no deductions for work-related expenses like literature, no work travel deductions. All of these deductions are, in general, available to salaried researchers, as they inevitably pay some level of tax on their salary.\nI cannot say the exact numbers (and I would love to see an economist work through them!), but these multiple disparities compound to make the net income of a grant researcher considerably lower than that of a salaried doctoral researcher. There are, however, a few attempts at solving this.\nUniversity of Eastern Finland was the first university in Finland to enact a university-wide policy of automatically salarying every grant researcher, regardless of position, with a 10 % part-time work contract. This enables grant researchers access to work healthcare and other resources, as well as places them legally in a similar position as other salaried researchers. This contract is only available for researchers with grants lasting at least one year, but the practice of giving working grants shorter than a year should regardless be discontinued, due to the major discontinuities such practices create.\nUEF enacted this policy in the summer of 2021, and it has since spread to the University of Oulu as well, with the University of Lapland currently negotiating conditions for such a policy. Oulu is, however, struggling with scenarios where group leaders retain veto rights to drafting contracts (argued to be related to budget-balancing necessities), which places grant researchers in unequal positions.\nAnother option, and one that I have not seen discussed before, is to raise grant sums above the taxable limit. This would require more precise calculations as to where a reasonable equilibrium lies - how much more should a grant researcher make to enable necessary tax rebates? This does present a new problem: as doctoral student intake has been growing year by year the past decades, increasing grant sizes exacerbates the already major problem of many researchers being left without grants, as well as risks shortening average grant lengths.\nIn total, the problem seems to me to be more a problem of how research financing is currently structured. Private grants are, I would argue, not a reasonable, effective, or fair and balanced way to run the doctoral-industrial complex. Foundations give out grants from their investment surplus, and if the pressure to give larger total sums increases, so will inevitably questionable investment practices become more commonplace. The most profitable investments are the most egregious and the ones at risk of (accidentally or purposefully) supporting human rights violations in the Global South.\nThus, one solution lies in increased public research expenditure, together with direct coupling of expenditure and doctoral education. If we want to produce more and more doctors every year, we need more and more money every year. The old dynasties of Kone, Hartwall, and Erkko should not be in charge of financing Finnish research excellence - the public should.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGuthrie, Susan, Catherine A.

    "text": "Title: Legitimating Academic Practice: Mapping the Diversity of Epistemic Logics in Finnish University Disciplines  Year: 2020  University: Åbo Akademi University  Supervisor: Docent, senior lecturer Mika Helander, Åbo Akademi University  Keywords: Legitimation Code Theory, university socialization, academic disciplines, epistemic logic, internal and external explanations, code homology  Permalink: https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe202002286885\nAbstract:  In the 2010s, the idea of the ‘post-truth’ society and the weakening of traditional knowledge institutions have become more commonplace. This discourse assumes a unified institutional academic science. In this thesis, I question whether the academic institution, in the Finnish context, is as unified as this discourse assumes. Using an online survey study, I apply Legitimation Code Theory as a perspective to take apart and analyse claims of knowledge legitimation among Finnish university students (n = 559). I thus analyse whether there are differences in Specialization codes between academic disciplines and whether these potential differences are caused by internal or external mechanisms such as social and educational background or university socialization. The results suggest that academic disciplines differ considerably in their underlying epistemic logics. While there are homologous disciplinary clusters on the highest level of analysis, applying an extension of the 4-K model from LCT causes these homologies to break down. The disciplines seem to tend towards extreme modes of knowledge legitimation. Simultaneously, however, differences between disciplines are found in epistemological details. This suggests that Finnish academia shares a common ontological base but differs in each discipline’s epistemological logic. The results further showed that students’ time at university is not a significant predictor of change in epistemic logics, contradicting prior research. However, this contradiction is uncertain due to bias and potential sampling error. Parental educational level predicts a significant change in legitimation codes, but this effect only holds for students with one or more doctoral-level parents and is not attributable to single legitimation code dimensions, suggesting an emergent property. Minority group membership is not a significant predictor of code difference, but this result may be due to model bias. The relevance of the extended 4-K model seems to depend on the purpose of classification, and further qualitative research is necessary to establish the details of the academic socialization process.\nData source: Coming soon!",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nMy partner and I recently got rights to rent an allotment garden nearby in the city. It is approximately 100 square metres, and took a lot of effort to turn and perma-culture to make it usable. The soil is mostly clay, which doesn’t hold too well water.\nBeing a bit of a techy myself, a thought occurred to me: “We have an Arduino board that we never use. What if we’d make some sort of sensor to let us know when to water?”. Very lazy, I admit, but an intriguing project.\nI have some programming background, mainly in R and Android Java development, so I thought it might be an easy enough project. A few weeks in now, and we’re seeing some progression, so I reckon I could write a few blog posts about it. This is the first post.\n\n\nArduino?\nThe Arduino microprocessor is a tiny and cheap integrated programming development board. It has everything you need to get started with some very rudimentary microprocessing development - but the magical part about it is that it scales to almost anything.\nReally, the only reason we chose the Arduino was that we have one at home. My partner had bought a starter kit some years back, which he fiddled with for a few weeks and left in a box to rot (rust?). So I thought we could use that!\nBasically, the Arduino (ours is an Uno Rev3) is a small computer with a lot of input and output pins. You interact with the computer by writing code in flavoured C++, which is compiled and transferred over to the Arduino’s internal memory. Once the device has power - through USB, a battery, or even solar panels - it runs the program.\nOn its own, it’s not very impressive. However, the Arduino admits almost any type of sensors, attachments, and devices to plug in. To interact with the world, you have gyroscopes, accelerometers, sensors for moisture, temperature, barometers, you name it.\n\n\nWhat’s the purpose, then?\nWe decided to start with one “simple” functionality: Measure the soil moisture at the allotment and transfer it wirelessly to us. This seems somewhat simple, but - as it turns out - every step has to be manually configured and constructed. Also, I need to learn C++, no biggie.\nTo break the steps down, we figured we need to do something like:\n\nMeasure the soil moisture using a sensor.\nBring that data into the Arduino.\nDo things to the data.\nStore the data.\n\nSo let’s get into what we have accomplished so far - which is mostly step one and two!\n\n\nReading the External World\nDespite what philosophers of science might argue, measuring the external world is actually very simple. For the Arduino, we opted to use the Grove ecosystem of sensors, since it seemed well-documented and easy-to-use.\nOur first purchases were the Grove connector shield and a pile of moisture sensors. The connector shield simply “translates” the special four-pin connector on most Grove sensors into the pins that the Arduino reads. The word “shield” means that it sits neatly on top of the Arduino, so that you don’t have to do any wiring. Neat!\nThe moisture sensors are small two-pronged forks with a four-pin cable attaching to the back of the sensor. The sensor runs a current through the prongs, measures the voltage and returns it through the chosen pin. Using the connector shield, we can hook the whole thing up to the analog pins (since it is only a simple analog current that is being read), in our current case, analog pin 0.\n\n\n\nMy current testing setup. The boards in the stack from top down: Grove connector shield, data logging shield, Arduino board. Analog pin 0 is connected through the Grove shield to the moisture sensor, which is sitting in a small potted plant.\n\n\nThis, essentially, takes care of step one! Of course, on its own, this does nothing - the Arduino must be told what to do with the data that comes in.\n\n\nReading from the Moisture Sensor\nAs mentioned, the Arduino is programmed in a language called C++ (with some extra Arduino flavour, I’ve understood). This language is pretty human-readable, though admittedly much more complex than my current working language, R. In a first, very preliminary testing setup, I managed to omit three or four semi-colons, breaking the code instantly…\nThus far, I’ve written a Sketch (the Arduino name for code scripts that are executed on the board) that takes an average of readings with a specific interval and over a defined number of readings, and prints it to the serial console (more on that later). This is the full script, in all its messy gloriness:\n```{cpp}\n// Setup Grove moisture pin\nint sensorPin = A0;\nint sensorValue = 0;\n\n// Setup average reading\nconst int numReadings = 15;   // Number of readings done before reporting\nconst int delayTime = 1000;   // Time between readings in ms\nint readings[numReadings];    // Array for storing readings, size of numReadings\nint readIndex = 0;            // Index for storing readings and iteration\nint total = 0;                // Storing total value for calculation\nint average = 0;              // Storing average value for reporting\n\nvoid setup() {\n  // put your setup code here, to run once:\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  // Intialize the reading array\n  for (int thisReading = 0; thisReading &lt; numReadings; thisReading++) {\n    readings[thisReading] = 0;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  total = 0;\n  // Iterate over numReadings and write reading to array, average out and print to serial.\n  for (readIndex; readIndex &lt;= numReadings; readIndex++) {\n    // Print final value and reset loop.\n    if (readIndex == numReadings) {\n        // Calculate value\n        average = total / numReadings;\n        Serial.print(\"Moisture average = \");\n        Serial.println(average);\n        // Reset the reading array\n        for (int thisReading = 0; thisReading &lt; numReadings; thisReading++) {\n          readings[thisReading] = 0;\n        }\n      // Reset the index and start over\n      readIndex = 0;\n      break;\n    } else {\n      // If not \n      readings[readIndex] = analogRead(sensorPin);\n      total += readings[readIndex];\n    }\n  delay(delayTime);\n  }\n}\n```\nArduino code is written in three main areas, from top to bottom:\n\nLibraries and variable declaration.\nThe setup() function.\nThe loop() function.\n\nArea one defines which libraries are being used (if any), as well as declares all variables into memory. This is something that is not done in R, but I remember it faintly from my Java adventures some years back. Essentially, I tell the computer “Hey! I want to use a number called number later on, please reserve space for it in the memory!” which the computer then does. This is that area in the above script:\n```{cpp}\n// Setup Grove moisture pin\nint sensorPin = A0;\nint sensorValue = 0;\n\n// Setup average reading\nconst int numReadings = 15;   // Number of readings done before reporting\nconst int delayTime = 1000;   // Time between readings in ms\nint readings[numReadings];    // Array for storing readings, size of numReadings\nint readIndex = 0;            // Index for storing readings and iteration\nint total = 0;                // Storing total value for calculation\nint average = 0;              // Storing average value for reporting\n```\nHere, I define which sensor pin will be read and create a variable for its value. I also seet up a number of variables to help me work the data, the most important ones being numReadings and readings[numReadings]. The former defines how many readings will be done (fifteen in this example), and the latter is an array storing the data read from each reading. The array is defined as an integer (number) array of size numReadings, so that it can fit all the necessary sensor readings. Another important variable is delayTime, which defines, in milliseconds, how long to wait between each reading.\nCombining these three currently, the script is set up to take a reading every second fifteen times (i.e., over fifteen seconds).\nThe second area is the setup() function. This area is ran only once, when the script is executed or started. This can be when the Arduino receives power, or when I upload a new Sketch to the device.\n```{cpp}\nvoid setup() {\n  // put your setup code here, to run once:\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  // Intialize the reading array\n  for (int thisReading = 0; thisReading &lt; numReadings; thisReading++) {\n    readings[thisReading] = 0;\n  }\n}\n```\nHere, I first tell the Arduino to begin transmitting stuff over the serial connection, i.e., the USB cable. This ensures that I can actually read what is going on in the device - otherwise everything is stuck inside it, with no direct way to access it (unless I make a way…).\nAfter that, I initialize the results array with a bunch of zeroes. This simply fills up the fifteen-slot readings array with zeroes - once again, things R abstracts and does away with.\nThe real meat is in the third area, the loop() function. This is ran over and over again (hence, “loop”) for as long as the device runs, or until I somehow tell it to stop. Anything that should be repeated multiple times should go in here - like our moisture tracking!\n```{cpp}\nvoid loop() {\n  total = 0;\n  // Iterate over numReadings and write reading to array, average out and print to serial.\n  for (readIndex; readIndex &lt;= numReadings; readIndex++) {\n    // Print final value and reset loop.\n    if (readIndex == numReadings) {\n        // Calculate value\n        average = total / numReadings;\n        Serial.print(\"Moisture average = \");\n        Serial.println(average);\n        // Reset the reading array\n        for (int thisReading = 0; thisReading &lt; numReadings; thisReading++) {\n          readings[thisReading] = 0;\n        }\n      // Reset the index and start over\n      readIndex = 0;\n      break;\n    } else {\n      // If not \n      readings[readIndex] = analogRead(sensorPin);\n      total += readings[readIndex];\n    }\n  delay(delayTime);\n  }\n}\n```\nThe code contains a few nested things, i.e., things inside of things. The main stuff happens inside the for loop. This loop starts from the value of readIndex, which in the start is zero, and runs repeatedly, every time incrementing readIndexby one. Finally, when the index becomes equal to the number of readings I want to do, we stop. Essentially, thus, it represents every reading that I want to do.\nInside this loop exists an if-else statement. The first part, under if, is executed if the index is equal to the number of readings, and represents the case of “We’re done now, time to wrap up and leave.” The second part, under else, is executed in all other cases - meaning every reading we do.\nStarting with the else section (since it, paradoxically, is the main stuff we’re doing here), I take a reading from the moisture sensor using analogRead(sensorPin) and store it in its place in readings. I then add it to a total, and we’re done! Before the for loop exists, I delay execution for the amount of time I defined in-between readings, so that we don’t read a million-billion times a second.\nThe if statement is executed when I’ve determined that I’ve had enough readings, so it should only run once for every average reading. It simply calculates the average, prints it to the serial console, and resets the relevant variables for a new average reading. The seriar console is a small box inside the Arduino IDE (the software I write this stuff in), which can function as a kind-of screen for anything I want. Finally, the break keyword is used to tell the computer, “Stop this loop immediately!”. This means that the loop is guaranteed to stop, and nothing underneath the keyword is ran.\n(And as I was writing this blog, it occurred to me: this means that the delay is not executed, throwing the whole thing off slightly! I will fix this in the next iteration, probably by removing the break altogether.)\nThe product of this whole code snippet is some average moisture levels, as measured in voltage. Since the text is not very cool to look at, I used the Serial Plotter function inside the Arduino IDE to produce a cute little plot of the values coming in:\n\n\n\nGraph of moisture values. X-axis indicates time (technically, the running order of the measurements), and the Y-axis indicates measurement in voltage (with some modification).\n\n\nIn this particular interval, the moisture level was going up. Since the plant had been sitting out in the heat the whole day, I presume this was some sort of “getting used to”-situation. Alternatively, it could be water precipitating out of the soil - I genuinely have no idea, I’m a social scientist!\n\n\nWhat Now?\nThis concludes step two, and to a certain extent step three, of the process. The next part will look at storing this data, as currently, I have no storage medium available. However, as the picture showed, I went and bought a data logging shield today, which comes with SD card storage. My current thought is to push the data into the EEPROM (essentially, some slightly more stable memory that persists through power failure), and then read from the EEPROM and write to the SD card in more infrequent intervals.\nThe main difficulty, however, will be the wireless transmission. As it turns out, there are plenty of options, some free, some expensive, all difficult to set up. Currently, I’m leaning towards a LoRaWAN implementation, but we’ll see as things progress.\nThe data should be wirelessly transmitted to the Arduino IoT cloud, from where I’d be pulling it into a webapp for stats graphing (yay!) and an Android app for sending automated notifications when the soil is running dry.\nOther things still on the list include weatherproofing this whole shebang, and figuring out power (solar power, baybee! Unless it turns out to be infeasible). There’s a whole lot left, so I’ll return with more blogs - thanks for reading! :)\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{saal2023,\n  author = {Saal, Oliver},\n  title = {Building a {Wireless} {Moisture} {Sensor} with {Arduino} -\n    {Part} {I}},\n  date = {2023-06-28},\n  url = {https://osaal.github.io/posts/arduinoadventure01.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nSaal, Oliver. 2023. “Building a Wireless Moisture Sensor with\nArduino - Part I.” June 28, 2023. https://osaal.github.io/posts/arduinoadventure01.html."

Julkinen liikenne on tällainen.\nMiksi sitten julkista liikennettä kohdellaan taloudellisesti tasapainoitettavana sijoituskohteena? Vastaus löytynee NPM-ideologiasta. Suosittu argumentti julkisen sektorin pienentämiselle on sen tehottomuus - yksityiset markkinat nyt vain tuottavat tehokkaammin, koska siellä kilpaillaan kunnolla. Tällä logiikalla on varmasti katsottu, että julkisesti tuotettu joukkoliikenne on tehotonta toimintaa, jossa pyöritellään peukaloita ja ajetaan ani harva linja-autovuoro.\nJulkisen liikenteen tehtävä ei kuitenkaan ole tienata rahaa, vaan mahdollistaa kansalaisten vapaan liikkuvuuden ja vapaan asutuksen oikeuksien todellisen toteutumisen. Julkinen liikenne varmistaa, että vähävaraiset henkilöt pääsevät töihin, vapaa-ajan viettoon, kulttuurin pariin - että he pääsevät liikkumaan kaikkialla kaupungissa. Jos julkisin varoin tuotetaan kaupunkeja, rakennettua ympäristöä, kulttuuria ja koulutusta, miksi niiden etuoville pääsy olisi kiinni yksityisestä rahasta?"

We propose that in terms of risk\n    perception, risks should be seen as interconnected, intuitively\n    valued, and socially mediated. Using factor analysis, we construct a\n    General Risk Probability Perception Scale (GRPPS) and analyse the\n    variance in risk perception in three different models. We found\n    support for the hypothesis that risk perception is a unitary\n    construct, as opposed to composed of singular risk related\n    perceptions of probability. General risk perception seems to be\n    related to experiences of actual risk, whether direct, near-miss or\n    professional. For social variables, only being male or elderly\n    predicts a higher general perception of risk.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nSaal, Oliver, and Alisa Puustinen. 2023. “Measuring Subjective\nRisk Perception as a Latent Construct.” Unpublished Manuscript.\nhttps://osaal.github.io/articles/saalpuustinen2023.html."
