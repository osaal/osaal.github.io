::: {#first-section}
I'm a human researcher specialized in quantitative methods, work and organization psychology, and security research. My broader academic interests are in modern quantitative social research, e.g., latent factor models and structural equation modeling, as well as open science and reproducibility. My free time is spent watching RuPaul's Drag Race, producing documentary films, and hobby programming.
